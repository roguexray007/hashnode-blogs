# Introduction

Hello Readers! 👋 I’m excited to share a unique setup that I’ve been using, which has significantly enhanced my productivity as a developer. 💡

## Identifying the Bottleneck ❓

During development sprints, I noticed a recurring issue. Tasks often reach the `development complete` stage but get `delayed during the review process`⏳. As a developer, my workflow involves frequent switching between GoLand and the terminal. In this process, I sometimes miss Slack notifications for PR reviews, causing them to get lost in the shuffle and leading to delays. 🔎

I attempted to address this by integrating GitHub with Slack and setting reminders for PR reviews. However, these weren’t referred to as frequently as needed. 🔔

## Crafting the Solution 🛠️

To keep track of my Jira tasks, to-do’s, and GitHub PR review requests on the screens I switch between most frequently, I decided to build a dashboard on the terminal. 💻

This terminal dashboard displays all the information I need, right where I need it, helping me stay on top of my tasks and reviews. 📈

## A Sneak Peek 👀

I’ve included a screenshot of the dashboard for your reference.
