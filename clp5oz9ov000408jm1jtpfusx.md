# Introduction

As a software developer, I often find myself grappling with the challenge of parsing and viewing logs on the terminal. Without color coding and formatting, it can be a daunting task to make sense of the vast streams of data. But then, I discovered [Loggo](https://github.com/aurc/loggo) .

Loggo is a game-changer. It leverages the capabilities of your terminal to parse log streams based on JSON-based logs, bringing clarity and structure to what was once a sea of confusing data.The difference it has made in my day-to-day tasks as a developer is nothing short of impressive.

I highly recommend giving Loggo a try. Itâ€™s not just about making tasks easier, but also about enhancing your productivity and efficiency as a developer. Trust me, once you start using Loggo, youâ€™ll wonder how you ever managed without it.

## How to Use Loggo? ðŸ¤”

### Installation

Installing Loggo is a straightforward process and the developers have provided detailed instructions for various methods of installation. You can find the complete installation guide on the \[official GitHub page\] of Loggo. The guide covers installation methods for different platforms and environments, including macOS/Linux with Homebrew/Linuxbrew, installation with Go, building from source, and downloading pre-compiled binaries. Make sure to follow the instructions that best suit your setup. Happy coding!

### Features

Loggo is a versatile tool with a range of features that make it a powerful asset for managing log streams. Here are some of its key features:

1. **Stream Parsed Logs from a Persisted File**: Loggo can read and parse logs from a persisted file. This means you can save your logs in a file and use Loggo to read and interpret them later. This is particularly useful for post-mortem analysis or for sharing logs with your team.
    
2. **Stream Parsed Logs from a Piped Input**: Loggo can also read logs from a piped input. This allows you to pipe logs from another process directly into Loggo, enabling real-time log analysis.
    
3. **Log Templates**: Loggo provides a tool for creating log templates. This allows you to define the structure of your logs, making it easier to parse and understand them.
    
4. **Local Log Filtering/Search**: Loggo offers local log filtering and search capabilities. This means you can filter and search your logs based on specific criteria, making it easier to find the information youâ€™re looking for.
    
5. **Unaffected Main Log Stream**: With Loggo, the main log stream remains unaffected regardless of the source (gcp, pipe, file, etc.). This ensures that your original log data remains intact.
    
6. **Display Only Matching Log Entries**: Loggo displays only log entries that match your search/filter criteria. This helps to declutter your log view and focus on the logs that matter.
    

### Usage

**From Pipe:**

```plaintext
tail -f <my file> | loggo stream
```

#### Kubernetes

```plaintext
kubectl logs -f -n <namespace> <pod> | loggo stream
```

## Conclusion

Loggo is a powerful tool for developers who need to manage and understand log streams. Its rich Terminal User Interface and compatibility with various platforms make it a versatile tool in the developerâ€™s toolkit. Whether youâ€™re running applications locally or on a Kubernetes cluster, Loggo can help you make sense of your log streams.
